# Java CLI Starter

This is a small example of how you can build a  Java CLI app. It uses Picocli as the command-line library and tinylog for logging. 


## Building a fat jar

If you want to pack you CLI app into a single (fat) jar file that contains all necessary libraries, run the "Build fat jar" gradle target. The file is saved to build/lib/\[title\]-\[version\]-all.jar.
